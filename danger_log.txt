01.23: when creating a ride, if the user input an invalid datetime, the app will take it as a valid input

01.24: fixed by using django datetimefield method

01.25: share ride may delete original ride

01.26: 01.25's risk can be fixed by separating the share ride and original ride into two models

01.27 We find that when mulitple sharers add in one share ride, number of total passengers went wrong.

01.28 We find that when driver confirmed a ride, ride creater cannot view the status update.

01.29 We find that when driver confimed a share ride, sharers cannot view the status update.

01.30 We find that when a ride is completed, riders can still modify ride detail.
